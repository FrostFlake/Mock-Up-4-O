    <h2>"Bag Lady, you gon' hurt yo back...draggin all them bags like that...."</h2>
    <p>Holistic Mental Health Wellness Coaching is a style of intervention that provides a relaxed, non-judgemental and understanding environment. As a practitioner we collaborate I do not dictate. My job is to help you be you in your most elevated form.</p>
    <h3>MY STORY</h3>
    <p>Working as a Master's Level Clinician since 2017, Iâ€™ve been clinically trained and supervised in a host of intervention spaces, and continue to receive supervision from licensed practitioners.</p>
<p>With over ten thousand hours of client interaction experience, I have a breadth of personal and professional experiences that I bring to interventions. </p>
